### Tests
You're recommended to test your React components. There are a couple examples in the `test` folder.
To run tests: `gulp test`. Alternatively, you can run `npm test`.

### ES6
You can develop modules and write tests using [ES6](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features) syntax. In the background, [Babel](https://babeljs.io) is used to transpile to web-friendly ES5.   

### Styles
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) is included by default but it's very easy to remove it. Simply go to `public/index.html` and remove the 2 lines that reference Bootstrap CSS and JS files.
